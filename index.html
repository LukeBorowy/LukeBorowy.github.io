                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm a student at the University of St. Thomas, and I am currently in my fourth year here. I am majoring in Computer Science, as well as in Spanish. 
                    I was previously only minoring in Spanish, but I have decided to switch to a double major instead. </p>
                <p>
                    I would consider computer science and programming to be my primary interest, having programmed since childhood in several different languages. I have experienced and enjoyed coding in a wide array of applications, including video games, simulations, machine learning, web development, and robotics. I love working with technical systems and the logical problem-solving is very satisfying when making my own projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to major in Spanish just because I enjoyed learning the language. I am following the lingustics track within the major, which interests me due to the similarities to computer science in many aspects, due to the analytical way in which language is studied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After college, I hope to have a career as a software developer, although I'm not set on a specific subfield yet.
                </p>
